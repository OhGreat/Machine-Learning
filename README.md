# Machine-Learning
A collection of Machine Learning examples in Python with sklearn and tensorflow.

The tensorflow examples are in the tensorflow folder, all the rest are models made with sklearn.
What these models consist of are mostly of data exploration. Once the data is formatted succesfully it can be passed to a model in order to predict one or more of its carachteristics.
